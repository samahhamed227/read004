# JavaScript

## JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, 
just-in-time compiled programming language
 with first-class functions. While it is 
most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages,
 many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js,
 Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, 
multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, 
supporting object-oriented, imperative, 
and declarative (e.g. functional programming)

#### Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language.
  #### However, the two programming languages have very different syntax,
####  semantic, and use.
